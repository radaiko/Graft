# v0.2.0

The biggest Graft update yet. Commands are reorganized, stacks remember where you left off, and there's a brand-new way to clean up your repo.

## Active Stack

No more typing the stack name on every command. Graft now tracks your **active stack** -- set it once, and every operation just works.

- `graft stack init` automatically activates the new stack.
- `graft stack sw <name>` switches between stacks.
- If you only have one stack, it's selected for you.

Every stack command (`push`, `pop`, `drop`, `shift`, `commit`, `sync`, `log`) operates on the active stack by default.

## Grouped Commands

Commands are now organized into clean, logical groups:

```
graft stack   init | ls | sw | push | pop | drop | shift | commit | sync | log | del
graft wt      <branch> [-c] | del <branch> [-f] | ls | goto <branch>
graft nuke    [wt | stack | branches] [-f]
```

Everything lives where you'd expect it. Stack operations under `stack`, worktree operations under `wt`.

## Nuke

New top-level command for when you need a clean slate:

- `graft nuke` -- remove all Graft resources from the repo
- `graft nuke wt` -- tear down all worktrees
- `graft nuke stack` -- remove all stacks
- `graft nuke branches` -- clean up local branches whose upstream is gone

All destructive operations require `--force` or prompt for confirmation.

## Sync Now Pushes

`graft stack sync` merges your stack branches **and** pushes them. No more separate push step -- your remote stays in sync automatically.

## New Commands

- `graft stack sw <name>` -- switch active stack
- `graft stack shift <branch>` -- insert a branch at the bottom of the stack
- `graft stack del <name>` -- delete a stack
- `graft wt goto <branch>` -- cd into a worktree

## Breaking Changes

- Top-level stack commands (`graft init`, `graft push`, `graft sync`, etc.) are now under `graft stack`.
- `graft worktree` shortened to `graft wt`.
- Worktree paths now follow a fixed convention (`../<repo>.wt.<branch>/`) and no longer require a metadata file.

## Web UI

- Stack and worktree views updated for the new command structure.
- Nuke operations available from the UI.
