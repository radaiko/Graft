A cross-platform CLI tool for managing stacked branches and git worktrees.

## What It Does

Git's stacked branches and worktree features are powerful but ergonomically painful. Graft fixes that:

- **Stacked branches** — Track dependencies, merge parent branches bottom-to-top, commit to any branch in a stack
- **Worktree management** — Create and manage git worktrees with a fixed naming convention
- **Web UI** — Browser-based visual interface for stacks and worktrees (`graft ui`)
- **Repo discovery & navigation** — Scan directories for repos, navigate by name or branch with `graft cd`
- **Cross-repo status** — See branch, ahead/behind, changed files, stacks, and worktrees across all repos
